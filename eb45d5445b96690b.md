We have an amp-form which has contact us template. We want to send contact us content to our Slack channel.
What are the additional modules which we have to install in node.js and how to implement it?

To send message to Slack from amp-form using node.js:

I assume that you already have account in Slack.
1. You need to create Webhook uri in slack. [Reference](https://slack.com/intl/en-in/help/articles/115005265063-Incoming-webhooks-for-Slack)
2. Create a Slack channel to which you want to send messages.
3. The modules which you will have to install are slack-node and multer.
4. [Here is the code](https://gist.github.com/ankitadhandha/8ddac4a284231ac8c8bce1b822cf7069)
5. amp-form must have action-xhr set to "messages".
