How to implement Gmail Auth using Node.js?


Following modules are important for Gmail oAuth:
* Passport
* Passport-google-oAuth

For Gmail Authentication, please follow these steps on [google console](https://console.developers.google.com):
* Goto APIs & Services.
* Click on Credentials.
* Click on oAuth ClientID.
* Configure OAuth Consent Screen.
* Create oAuth Client ID.
* Enter Name of the Project.
* Authorized Javascript Origins: https://example.com (Use your domain name).
* Authorized redirect URIs: https://example.com/amp-access/amp-access/login/gmail_login/callback. (Use your domain name).
* Save and note Client ID, Client secret and use it in  auth.js file.

Here are few sample code for your reference:

[auth.js file configuration](https://gist.github.com/ankitadhandha/1dc96bcfb6c286808de56bc2951411cf)

login.js is created inside `amp-access/amp-access/login/login.js`:

[login.js file configuration](https://gist.github.com/ankitadhandha/1dc96bcfb6c286808de56bc2951411cf)

amp html should look like this:

`<span amp-access="NOT subscriber" amp-access-hide role="button" tabindex="0">
<a href="[/amp-access/amp-access/login/gmail_login] class="logout">Login</a>
</span>`
