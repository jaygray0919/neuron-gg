* The last hydrolysis that releases the active oxytocin nonapeptide is catalyzed by peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase (PAM).

* The activity of the PAM enzyme system is dependent upon vitamin C (ascorbate), which is a necessary vitamin cofactor. 
* By chance, sodium ascorbate by itself was found to stimulate the production of oxytocin from ovarian tissue over a range of concentrations in a dose-dependent manner. 
* Many of the same tissues (e.g. ovaries, testes, eyes, adrenals, placenta, thymus, pancreas) where PAM (and oxytocin by default) is found are also known to store higher concentrations of vitamin C.

* sodium ascorbate
	* Sodium ascorbate is one of a number of mineral salts of ascorbic acid (vitamin C).
	* As a food additive, it has the E number E301

* The oxytocin receptor is a G-protein-coupled receptor that requires Mg2+ and cholesterol. 
* It belongs to the rhodopsin-type (class I) group of G-protein-coupled receptors.

oxytocin and some of its receptors are found in the gastrointestinal tract
reducing stress in gut may help promote natural production of oxytocin
