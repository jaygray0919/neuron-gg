is a hormone that acts as a neurotransmitter in the brain. It was the first polypeptide hormone to be sequenced &amp; synthesized biochemically, for which this chap was awarded the

it is believed to influence social cognition &amp; behavior. Some refer to it as the &quot;Bliss Hormone.&quot; If you want more bliss, here's the chemistry, biology and food story.

Oxytocin nonapeptide (oxytocin bioactivity) is catalyzed by peptidylglycine alpha&#45;amidating monooxygenase (PAM). PAM activity is dependent upon
	vitamin C ChEFS

The oxytocin receptor requires

to do its work.

Oxytocin &amp; its receptors are found in the gastrointestinal tract. Reducing stress in gut may promote oxytocin bioactivty. Fermented 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probiotic" title="">probiotic</a> foods reduce gut stress, such as live&#45;cultured yogurt, sauerkraut, kombucha tea, &amp; common green pickles.
