* Cholesterol synthesis is effectively started by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA [HMG-CoA](https://wedge.ontomatica.io/ChEMATIC_-_19-09-06/Wedge?q=facet_MC_04:95000001/facet_MC_06:93000001/facet_MC_12:86056996/facet_MC_13:85049779/facet_MC_18:79065289/facet_MC_23:74005472/facet_MD_13:68489904&group=facet_MC_13)

* The next step is catalyzed by HMG-CoA reductase. [Click here](https://wedge.ontomatica.io/ChEMATIC_-_19-09-06/Wedge?q=facet_MD_08:68275212)

* This is the site of action for the statin drugs [HMG-CoA reductase competitive inhibitors](https://wedge.ontomatica.io/ChEMATIC_-_19-09-06/Wedge?q=facet_MC_04:95000001/facet_MC_06:93000001/facet_MC_14:84000001/facet_MC_15:83069748/facet_MC_18:79173869/facet_MC_19:78007104/facet_MC_20:77000001/facet_MD_27:68521089&group=facet_MC_06).

* Because cholesterol is not water soluble, it is transported in blood in lipoproteins.

###ChEMATIC lipids &amp; [lipoproteins](https://wedge.ontomatica.io/ChEMATIC_-_19-09-06/Wedge?q=facet_MD_10:68302775/facet_MD_12:68419345&group=facet_MD_10)

* When more low density lipoproteins (LDL) exists in the blood than can be taken up by LDL receptors, excess LDL is formed into foam cells that become trapped in the walls of blood vessels. The end result is plaque, the major cause of heart attacks &amp; strokes. 

* Some plant products contain cholesterol&#45;like compounds called phytosterols may lower LDL cholesterol.
