The pigment in strawberries is [pelargonidin 3-glucoside](https://wedge.ontomatica.io/ChEFS_-_19-09-06/Wedge?q=facet_ChEBI_R105:215611).
It's 1 of 3 [anthocyanins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthocyanin) that contribute to red color in ripe fruit.
Here is a view of the [molecule](https://cactus.nci.nih.gov/chemical/structure/ABVCUBUIXWJYSE-GQUPQBGVSA-O/twirl).
Check out the Inchikey & use it to search for [related data](https://www.google.com/search?q=ABVCUBUIXWJYSE-GQUPQBGVSA-O).
Interestingly, it's associated with several [diseases](https://wedge.ontomatica.io/ChEMATIC_-_19-09-06/Wedge?q=facet_MC_10:88010490/facet_MC_14:84111881/facet_MC_18:79019390/facet_MD_03:68212738&group=facet_MC_10).
It interacts with the [HGNC:PDE](https://www.genenames.org/data/gene-symbol-report/#!/hgnc_id/HGNC:8784) gene.
A quick check of [Guide to Pharmacology Database](https://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/ObjectDisplayForward?objectId=1304)
tells us "PDE5 is highly expressed in vascular and bronchial smooth muscle, in renal tubules and in platelets" which translates to: it may be therapy for cardiovascular disease. Here's an [article](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17305584/) with more detail.
Tom Brady [doesn't eat strawberries](https://www.thecut.com/2018/03/tom-brady-strawberries-dieting.html), but maybe you should.
