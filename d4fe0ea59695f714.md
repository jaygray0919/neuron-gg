One key marketing message:

- On our site you are anonymous

- We do not use tracking technologies
- We do not sell or share your personal information
- We do not use third-party services that can identify you when we run those services for you
- We do not sell third-party advertising
- We **do** collect and use information that we, *exclusively*, use to protect and manage the site
  - (We'll have additional text here when we implement `amp-access` in release-0.1)

What does that mean for us?

- We need light analytics, but can't use google analytics. Therefore we should use something like [this](https://missiveapp.com/blog/privacy-first-analytics):
- We probably should self-host our fonts, rather than use the Google Font CDN service. I don't know the extent to which a user's IP address is associated with accessing our pages that embed the Google Font CDN URL.
- We should self host our JavaScript libraries, such as jQuery. We will need to prune and test this carefully. Unfortunately we use many flavors/versions of jQuery. As we prune we should test whether older programs work using our tested jQuery baseline
- We should host the MIT Exhibit libraries (WEDGE-Client). There is MIT documentation on this, and the libraries are accessible

The attention to privacy also highlights dependencies in our programs.

- When the Python MathJax libraries for Sphinx went offline, our Sphinx applications broke.

We are similarly exposed in a number of other areas.

We should **do nothing soon or quickly** WRT to the above; small incremental improvements over months is the proper pace.

And we should do nothing until we can version each target page as part of a CI/CD process.

We need to be able to systematically unwind changes if the change causes a fault.
