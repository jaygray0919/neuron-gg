Until the mid-1980s,<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=CHEBI:16480">nitric oxide</a> (NO) &ndash; a short-lived, highly reactive, toxic gas &ndash; was best known as an air pollutant from internal combustion engines (but produced for and used on a huge scale in the<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostwald_process" target="_blank">Ostwald process</a> for the manufacture of<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=CHEBI:48107">nitric acid</a>). The independent discovery by<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Furchgott" target="_blank">Robert Furchgott</a>,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Ignarro" target="_blank">Louis Ignarro</a> and<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferid_Murad" target="_blank">Ferid Murad</a> that nitric oxide was endogenously produced and acted as a<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signaling_molecule" target="_blank">signalling molecule</a> between cells, playing a vital role in regulating blood pressure and circulation, was completely unexpected and opened up new areas of biomedical research. For their breakthrough, Professors Furchgott, Ignarro and Murad shared the<a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1998/" target="_blank">Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine</a> in 1998. During his Nobel acceptance speech, Furchgott noted the irony that<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_nobel" target="_blank">Alfred Nobel</a>, celebrated for his work with<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=CHEBI:28787">nitroglycerin</a> and<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamite" target="_blank">dynamite</a>, had suffered from<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angina_pectoris" target="_blank">angina</a>, for which he was prescribed nitroglycerin [1]. Furchgott, Ignarro and Murad's work led researchers to the explanation of why nitroglycerin is so effective in treating heart pain: it is actually a<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=CHEBI:50266">prodrug</a>, being converted by mitochondrial<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldehyde_dehydrogenase" target="_blank">aldehyde dehydrogenase</a> (<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intenz/query?cmd=SearchID&id=18758" target="_blank">EC 1.2.1.3</a>) in the body into nitric oxide, which is a natural<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=CHEBI:35620">vasodilator</a> [2].
